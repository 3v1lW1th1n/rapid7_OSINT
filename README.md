# rapid7_OSINT
All the tools you need to make your own mind up from the Open Data SetsThis is a set of OSINT tools,. They are all the tools you need to make up your own mind

This shows the worrying, frightening, interesting and funny side of what is out there on the web.

The files are as follows.

Runme.sh, downloads a sample file and creates some basic OSINT (txt) files. Most people will want to start here.

intensive_search.py, does all the WHOIS, DNS Lookups. Not for the faint hearted.

rapid7_downloader.py, The free files change once a month, Download them here. 

json_parser.py, create outfile.csv used by runme.sh

Any press, media, collaborations please email me at contact@jamessawyer.co.uk

I have a need for more server power to do more research if you are interested. Please feel free to use my tools as you see fit but please credit me. 

Massive Thanks to…
