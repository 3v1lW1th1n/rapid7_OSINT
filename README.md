# rapid7_OSINT

**default searches** 

* "HP" - Printers, iLO devices!  Nothing personal but this is low hanging fruit. Alot of these include the serial number in clear text. If you are a "Social Engineer" of sorts I am sure this is useful to some. 
* "phone" - Video conferencing is a big thing now right?? Wonder who these belong to and if you can just join int? 
* "cisco" - Unwitting Sysadmin who have exposted their core network to the world. 
* "DVR" - Free TV right from the comfort of your own living room... or someone elses. 
* "Index of" - Free stuff
* "Schneider" - Electrical control system
* "Industrial"  - Electrical control system

Remove the monopoly "Web Servers"...Apache, nginx, Microsoft, lighttpd, xxxxxxxx-xxxxx, xxxx. 
These have their own tools and associated problems and this is not in scope here. We are looking here for the interesting, quirky, slightly obscure. Mainly IoT Devices, Some uncommon stuff. Cameras, Printers, Service Control Mechanisms etc.

Here I looked at **most" ports excluding the big files and this is the list of services minus the ones removed as discussed.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tg12/rapid7_OSINT/master/list_of_servers.txt

This is a count of how often each server type if you will occurs. 

in "scans" I have included two. One very interesting which I had to Google. Scary stuff...

https://sec-consult.com/en/blog/2018/05/tr-069-iot-before-it-was-cool/

Basically remote management for CPE devices (home broadband)

The other Hikvision, The popular home security cameras. 

Here is a list URL/Size in MB, It's organised by port number. It's a trade off by file size and what ports would be useful and most common. 
I don't have enough disk space on any of my fast VPS's to get the large one but I'd like to some day.
